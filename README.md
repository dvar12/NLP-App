# NLP Sentiment Analysis App

Welcome to the NLP Sentiment Analysis App README! This basic project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and integrates with RapidAPI for NLP functionalities. The app allows users to register, set passwords, log in, and then analyze the sentiment of input sentences.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can register themselves by providing their details.
- **Password Setting:** Registered users can set their passwords securely.
- **Login System:** Once registered, users can log in securely using their credentials.
- **Sentence Sentiment Analysis:** Users can input sentences, and the app will analyze the sentiment of the sentences and provide feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for developing the app.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Used for structuring the code into classes and objects for better organization and reusability.
- **RapidAPI:** Integrated for accessing NLP services and sentiment analysis functionalities.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** Utilized to provide an interactive interface for users.

## How to Use

1. **Register/Login:** Users need to register themselves first and set up their passwords. They can then log in using their credentials.
2. **Input Sentence:** Once logged in, users can input sentences into the app.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** The app will analyze the sentiment of the input sentence and provide feedback on the feelings conveyed by the sentence.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

* Run the Python script `app.py` to start the application.
